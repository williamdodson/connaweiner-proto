<p>Conna Weiner has provided strategic legal and compliance advice in the life sciences arena for over 20 years.</p> 

<p>After working at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison as a litigation associate on complex commercial and securities matters, she joined the Pharmaceuticals Division of Ciba-Geigy Corporation in 1993 (which ultimately became Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation upon its merger with Sandoz Corporation in 1997).</p> 

<p>Since then, she has amassed hands-on legal and compliance experience, in the U.S. and abroad, in connection with issues throughout the lifecycle of pharmaceutical and device industry development and commercialization. This has included research, development, manufacturing and supply, licensing, intellectual property, acquisitions, divestitures, sales, marketing and contracting, in numerous therapeutic areas, including oncology, transplant, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, various orphan diseases, ophthalmics, cardiology, companion and farm animal diseases and pest control, radiology and vascular intervention.</p>

<p>She has worked for branded and generic companies, human and animal pharmaceutical, vaccine and device manufacturers, and collaborated with their business partners, including hospitals, health plans, academic medical centers/universities, contract manufacturers, physicians, state and governmental entities. She has also been at the forefront of strategically managing significant, complex disputes, such as multidistrict antitrust litigations and governmental investigations.</p>

<p>Conna has a broad and sophisticated understanding of the issues facing participants in the life sciences industry and more generally of the challenges facing companies and individuals involved in highly regulated, technical and innovative fields. With each passing year, the issue of how to prevent important internal and external business relationships from deteriorating into ill-advised conflict—derailing progress in important areas such as the development of new medicines and devices and healthcare generally—became a significant focus in Conna’s career.</p>
